I have a new idea called (NoCash). it is a website that makes cash transactions easier. as a customer I want to give cash and the problem is I don't want to get cash back as change as I don't carry my wallet so (NoCash) solves the problem as after the customer pays in cash. it will allow the change to be transfered into his bank account or have a gift card or get loyality benefits like discounts in some stores by using (NoCash) in your future transactions or donate to charity. I would like to make the project using MERN stack so make me the code to make both website and mobile app. as for the pages there should be 1) TransactionList: showing all the transaction done in the session 2) TransactionForm: the form should include the user ID is an input which should consist of CR-(5 digits) otherwise it is not a CR number in bahrain or just phone number which is 8 digits starting with 133 or 1344 or 1350 or 136 or 1600 or 1603 or 1606 or 1607 or 1610 or 1616 or 1619 or 6966 or 6969 or 6996 or 6999 or 80888 or 16171 or 165 or 166 or 17 or 31 or 320 or 323 or 380 or 384 or 387 or 389 or 39 or 3250 or 33 or 340 or 346 or 350 or 351 or 353 or 355 or 36 or 37 or 6111 or 6160 or 6500 or 6600 or 6688 or 6630 or 6633 or 6639 or 666 or 669 or 6966 or 6969 or 6996 or 6999 or 6300 or 6333 or 6361 or 6366 or 7178 or 77 or 6441 or 6670 or 6676 or 66786 or 66788 or 66797 or 66799 otherwise it is not a phone number. next on the form is recieved amount: which consists of a random number. next in the form is change amount: which should consists an amount between 0.001 to 19.999. next on the form is the payment method it will allow to have a gift card or get loyality benefits like discounts in some stores by using (NoCash) in your future transactions or donate to charity. 2% of the amount will be charged to the user
